I wrote a simple script (~ 70 lines) in 2019 to help the player of Jawaker on web app, while re-arrange my archive files I found it again.
This script will draw all cards of the game on the screen then start listening to the table stack and remove each card played on the table.
You need to copy/paste the script to console browser, and before starting each round execute reset() function only.
